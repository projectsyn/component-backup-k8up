= Upgrade component from v2 to v3

K8up v2.0.0 and also the respective Helm chart v2.0.0 introduced breaking changes that also affect this component.
The upgrade process of K8up itself is documented here: https://k8up.io/k8up/2.0/how-tos/upgrade.html.
Contrary to the Helm chart, this component already ships the necessary CRDs.

With component version 3.0.0, a new parameter `majorVersion` is introduced (with default value being `v2`).
This parameter, together with multi-instantiation, enables you to deploy both K8up versions at once.
With the CRDs having a new domain with K8up v2, it's essentially a new operator with no direct upgrade path.
K8up `Backup`, `Schedule` and similar objects will have to be manually migrated from `backup.appuio.ch/v1alpha1` to `k8up.io/v1` before K8up v1 can be shut down.

[NOTE]
====
Older Kubernetes versions < 1.16 (for example OpenShift 3.11) aren't supported anymore in K8up v2.
While you can upgrade the component version to v3, configuring the component with `majorVersion=v2` isn't recommended.
====

== Parameter changes

- `majorVersion` parameter is introduced with default value `v2`.
- `enabled` parameter is **deprecated**.
  This parameter was used as a temporary workaround to disable a component until Commodore could do it natively.
- `crd` parameter is **deprecated** (is only used for K8up v1).
- `monitoring_kube_state_metrics_job_name_label` parameter is **deprecated** (is only used for K8up v1).
- `images.wrestic` parameter is **deprecated** (is only used for K8up v1).
- Default value of `namespace` changed from `syn-backup` to `syn-backup-k8up`.
- Default value of `charts.k8up` changed from `1.x` to `2.x`.
- Default value of `images.k8up.registry` changed from `quay.io` to `ghcr.io`.
- Default value of `images.k8up.repository` changed from `vshn/wrestic` to `k8up-io/wrestic`.
- Default value of `images.wrestic.registry` changed from `quay.io` to `ghcr.io`.
- Default value of `images.wrestic.repository` changed from `vshn/wrestic` to `k8up-io/wrestic`.
- Default value of `images.wrestic.tag` changed from `v0.3.2` to `v0.3.3`.
- Default value of `monitoring_alerts.k8up_last_errors.expr` changed from `baas_backup_restic_last_errors[...]` to `k8up_backup_restic_last_errors[...]`.
  If `majorVersion=v1` then the previous value with `baas_backup_restic_last_errors[...]` is applied.

== Library changes

If you are importing `backup-k8up.libjsonnet` in other components, they have been adjusted to provision K8up v2 CRDs.
Following functions are affected:
- `Job`
- `Schedule`
- `PreBackupPod`

== Steps to run two instances at once

The recommended upgrade path is as follows:

. Update component version to v3.x.x

. Configure existing component instance for K8up v1.

----
 parameters:
   backup_k8up:
+    majorVersion: v1 <1>
+    namespace: syn-backup <2>
+    ...
----
<1> Override default value with `v1`
<2> The default for K8up v2 has changed, so keep the original or custom value here

. Compile and push cluster catalog.
  Verify that existing deployment for K8up v1 is upgraded correctly.

. Add another instance of this component, but with K8up v2.

 applications:
   - backup-k8up
+  - backup-k8up as k8up-v2 <1>
 parameters:
   backup_k8up:
     majorVersion: v1
     namespace: syn-backup
    ...
+  k8up_v2: <1>
+    majorVersion: v2 <2>
+    namespace: syn-backup-k8up <2>
+    helmReleaseName: k8upv2 <2>
+    ... <3>
----
<1> Use component instantiation
<2> You need to explicitly override these if running both instances at once
<3> Set specific settings to this instance if applicable

. Compile and push cluster catalog.
  Verify that existing deployment for K8up v1 is untouched.
  Verify that new deployment for K8up v2 is rolled out.
+
NOTE: If you are confident in the rollout you can also combine the comonent instantiation in one compilation.
+
IMPORTANT: This will already recreate K8up resources managed in other components that import `backup-k8up.libjsonnet` with K8up v2 CRDs!

. Migrate all K8up objects from `backup.appuio.ch/v1alpha1` to `k8up.io/v1`

== Steps to run after all objects are migrated to K8up v2

. Remove K8up v2 instance

. Compile and push cluster catalog.
