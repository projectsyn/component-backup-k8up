= Upgrade component from v2 to v3

K8up v2.0.0 and also the respective Helm chart v2.0.0 introduced breaking changes that also affect this component.
The upgrade process of K8up itself is documented here: https://k8up.io/k8up/2.0/how-tos/upgrade.html.
Contrary to the Helm chart, this component already ships the necessary CRDs.

== Parameter changes

- `enabled` parameter is **deprecated**.
  This parameter was used as a temporary workaround to disable a component until Commodore could do it natively.

== Steps

. Update component parameters in cluster config as outlined in section <<_parameter_changes,parameter changes>>
